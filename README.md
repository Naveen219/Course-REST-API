# Spring REST

This is a project on Spring REST. I created this project to test my understanding of Spring REST. 

I created a **Course REST API**.

Added full support for CRUD operations.

The User can make the following requests from Postman :

**GET**- To retrieve all the courses from the Server (Returned as an of array of JSON objects)

**GET/{id}** - To retrive the course having the given id

**POST** - To add a course to the list (Sent as a JSON object)

**PUT** - To update a course (Sent as a JSON object)

**DELETE/{id}** - To delete the course having the given id
